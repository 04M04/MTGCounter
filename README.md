# MTGCounter
Simple MagicTheGathering life counter

This is a simple to use mtg counter. 
It's made for 2 player 20 points.
I havend made the points customizable because it I simply doesn't need it.
I think how it works is pretty simple to understand.
There are + and - buttons and a none land symbol in the middle so you can reset the points to 20 each.
Have fun! ðŸ˜‹
